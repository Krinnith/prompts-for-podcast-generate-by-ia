A woman with long, flowing black hair partially tied back, wearing glasses, has dark black eyes and a serious expression. She is wearing a red top under a dark gray or black coat with a high, upturned collar. A complex, dark gray cybernetic or tattoo design covers part of her neck and upper chest, suggesting mechanical or bio-integrated elements. She also wears a single dark earring on her left ear. A strap of a bag or harness crosses her shoulder. The background is abstract and slightly blurred, featuring muted tones of orange, purple, and teal, suggesting a futuristic or urban setting with indistinct shapes that could represent buildings or technological elements. The overall style is reminiscent of digital art or a graphic novel, with sharp contrasts in lighting that highlight her features.
